###Always know how far you are from HeatSync Labs

Using the new wearable Xadow platform, Heatseeker makes finding your way to Heatsync labs easy. It also displays GPS-Accurate time. The GPS determines the location of the user, some magical calculations occur, and the watch outputs the distance to HeatSync Labs. Don't worry about keeping it plugged in, as it's battery powered.

Pictures of the finished product can be found in the Pictures folder in the root directory.

To make one you'll need:
* A Xadow Main Board
* A Xadow 124x64 OLED
* A Xadow GPS Module
* Various Leather Scraps
* Stylish trinkets
