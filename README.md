#HackPhx Team 3 - HeeetSeeeker
###Always know how far you are from HeatSync Labs

Using the new wearable Xadow platform, Heatseeker makes finding your way to Heatsync labs easy. It also displays GPS-Accurate time. The GPS determines the location of the user, some magical calculations occur, and the watch outputs the distance to HeatSync Labs. Don't worry about keeping it plugged in, as it's battery powered.

Pictures of the finished product can be found in the Pictures folder in the root directory.

To make one you'll need:
* A Xadow Main Board
* A Xadow 124x64 OLED
* A Xadow GPS Module
* Various Leather Scraps
* Stylish trinkets

Here's the process to make one:

1. Start by putting all of the Xadow components together with the included ribbon cables.
2. Download the custom Xadow-Arduino IDE from here: http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Xadow_Main_Board
3. Upload the code here from the HeeetSeeeker directory
4. Let your HeeetSeeeker lead you to HeatSync Labs
